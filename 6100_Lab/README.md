# Practical Lab Course 
The folder contains assignments and course materials
## 1. Assignments

### Project 1: Decision tree

Utilize the Titanic dataset to perform survival predictions using Decision Trees and Random Forests.
Complete this experiment on Kaggle and export your work as an .ipynb file.

### Project 2: Computer Vision

Please refer to the attachments for details. 
If you believe annotations are necessary for your solutions, add them directly to the notebook.

Please note that Assignment1.ipynb is worth 7 points, while Assignment2.ipynb is worth 8 points.

### Project 3: Natural Language Processing

Upon completion of the assignment, you will produce a csv file. This file needs to be submitted to the Kaggle platform for scoring.

### Project 4: Large Language Model Fine-Tuning

Upon completion of the assignment, you will produce a csv file. This file needs to be submitted to the Kaggle platform for scoring.

### Project 5: Prompt Engineering and Dialogue Summarization with FLAN-T5

Please engage in self-learning to further understand Prompt Engineering for LLMs.

### Project 6: Data-Centric AI - Dataset Curation

Please complete the notebook and submit it for grading.

### Project 7: Data-Centric AI - Label Errors

Complete the notebook and submit it for grading.

### Project 8: Data-Centric AI - Growing Dataset with Active Learning

Complete the notebook and submit it for grading.

### Project 9: Reinforcement Learning (to be updated)
Engage in self-learning, by referring to the guidance RL-Lab.pdf Download RL-Lab.pdf, to further understand Reinforcement Learning.

Try to summarize the learning outcome using PPT/Slides, Code (if any), and Results (if any).
