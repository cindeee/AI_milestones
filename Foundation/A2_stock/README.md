### Assignment 2: Stock Price Prediction

You will apply your skills in data analytics and machine learning to predict the future price of three publicly traded companies' stocks.

For those familiar with the U.S. stock, the target stocks are Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA).

For those familiar with the A-share, the target stocks are 贵州茅台 (600519), 獐子岛(002069), and 沪深300 (000300).

You will collect historical stock data, preprocess and clean the data, explore the data using data visualization tools, build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms, and evaluate the model's performance. 

You will then use your model to predict the future prices of the three stocks and test it with the latest/real-time stock dataset.

### Tasks example:

1. Collect historical stock data (or any forms of data, e.g., text social media, that might help prediction) from a public database, such as Tushare, Wind, Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Google Finance, for the given companies, which might include daily opening and closing prices, volume, and any other relevant metrics. Preprocess and clean the data to remove any missing values or outliers, if necessary.
2. Explore the data using data visualization tools to identify patterns or trends.
3. Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forests, or neural networks.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error.
5. Test the model on a separate dataset to see how well it generalizes to new data.
6. Use your model to predict the future prices of the three stocks and test it with the latest/real-time stock dataset.

### Criteria

##### Analysis: 
1. Data collection and preprocessing: Did you collect and preprocess the data effectively? 
2. Data exploration: Did you explore the data using data visualization tools to identify patterns or trends? 
3. Predictive model: Did you build an effective predictive model using machine learning algorithms? 
4. Model evaluation: Did you evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics? 
5. Generalization: Did you test the model on a separate dataset to see how well it generalizes to new data? 
6. Stock price prediction: Did you use your model to predict the future prices of the three stocks and test it with the latest/real-time stock dataset?

##### Performance:  
- The performance (evaluated by MSE for every hour, i.e., 9am, 10am, 11am, etc.) tested on 13 Nov will be taken as one of the indicators. Please submit your predictions on 13 Nov as a separate file so that we can evaluate your performance.
