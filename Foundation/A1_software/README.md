##### Q1 (data, 7 points). 
You need to collect/label/preprocess/analyze data, and select/train some simple models (e.g., decision tree or linear regression). It is an open task so that you can use any datasets (e.g., via data acquisition or web scraping). Please conduct an exploratory data analysis to show some details of your data. Also, you can customize the loss/objective/model/optimization components, construct the training/test data, and evaluate different metrics as long as justification is provided.

Please submit your answer using Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) together with the datasets. Note that your scores are mainly based on the description (how do you collect/label/preprocess data) and analysis (what do you learn from the data and the models) which demonstrates your understanding and development of this course rather than simply applying the techniques.

##### Q2 (linear regression, 3 points). 
Find the closed form solution for linear regression that minimizes the mean square error (MSE).
